Human: DO NOT GENERATE AN IMAGE. 19028596.png, This screenshot shows the current screen. Please provide the next step as an object with the following three keys:

'task_finished': A boolean value indicating whether the task has been completed or not.
'purpose': A brief description of the purpose of the next step, written in simple English.
'eval_func': A string containing the pyautogui function that needs to be evaluated in order to perform the next step.
Please make sure that your response includes all three keys, and that the 'eval_func' key contains a valid pyautogui function. The 'task_finished' key should be set to True once the task has been completed, and False otherwise.
AI: The screenshot you provided is of the current screen. The task is not yet finished, and the purpose of the next step is to evaluate the pyautogui function in order to perform the next step.

In each step reply with only an array, containing all three values. Once that is done, proceed to next step, this will go on till the task is complete. If you understand, reply with ok.
AI: Ok, I understand. I will use tools to observe images and provide an object containing three keys: 'task_finished': True if the task: Open Chrome and Tweet something. has been completed else False, 'purpose': description of the purpose of the next step, 'eval_func': a string with a valid pyautogui function to perform the next step. I will remember to provide the image file name loyally if it's provided in the last tool observation.

AI: I understand the game you have described. The object of the game is to complete the task of opening Chrome and tweeting something. The rules of the game are that each round I will provide an image and ask 'what is the next step?'. You will reply with a generated JSON object, having three keys: 'task_finished' (True if the task has been completed, False otherwise), 'purpose' (description of the purpose of the next step) and 'eval_func' (a string with a valid pyautogui function to perform the next step). I will wait for your question before replying and I should follow the rules rather than directly imagining from your game rules. Is that correct?

Human: hi
AI: Hi there! How can I help you?
Human: DO NOT GENERATE AN IMAGE. this is not a question about an image. you are going to play a game I invented,
the object of the game is to complete the given task:Open Chrome and Tweet something.,
the rules of the game are simple,
each round, I am going to provide an image, and ask 'image/image_name.png what is the next step ? generate object',
your reply should only be a object having three keys 'task_finished': True if the task: Open Chrome and Tweet something. has been completed otherwise False, 'purpose': description of the purpose of the next step, 'eval_func':a string with a valid pyautogui function to perform the next step, till the task has been completed,
if task has completed, then reply 'task_finished:True'
exactly like this,

Human: image/3dcd6c88.png, what is the next step ? generate object.
AI: pyautogui.hotKey('win', 'r')

stick to the rules rather than directly imagine from game rules, reply according to specified rules.
If you understand, say 'ok'.
AI: Ok
Human: provide a figure named image\8efe285a.png. The description is: a screenshote of a computer screen with a black background. This information helps you to understand this image, but you should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from my description. If you understand, say "Received".
AI: Received.
Human: DO NOT GENERATE AN IMAGE. image/8efe285a.png what is the next step ? generate object.
AI: The image is a screenshot of a computer screen with a black background. The next step is to open the Run window by pressing the 'Win' and 'R' keys.
