reply with an array of strings, containing the steps to undertake to complete the task.
AI: The steps to calculate 2+2 in a calculator are: opening the calculator, clicking on number 2, clicking on the + button, clicking on number 2, clicking on the = button, and reading the result as 4.
Human: DO NOT GENERATE AN IMAGE. remove everything including conjunctions and interjections from 'The steps to calculate 2+2 in a calculator are: opening the calculator, clicking on number 2, clicking on the + button, clicking on number 2, clicking on the = button, and reading the result as 4.' and leaving only steps separated by a comma.
AI: Opening calculator, clicking on number 2, + button, number 2, = button, reading result as 4.
Human: DO NOT GENERATE AN IMAGE. now for each instructional step, generate an array of three strings,
'task_finished': True if the task: Open Chrome and search about gandhi. has been completed otherwise False, 'purpose': description of the purpose of the next step, 'eval_func':a string with a valid pyautogui function to perform the next step,
AI: To complete the task: Open Chrome and search about gandhi., the following steps should be taken:

1. task_finished: False, purpose: open Chrome, eval_func: pyautogui.hotkey('win','r')
2. task_finished: False, purpose: type in 'chrome' in the search bar, eval_func: pyautogui.typewrite('chrome')
